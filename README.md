# Build and Deploy Your Own ChatGPT AI Application That Will Help You Code

# CLIENT SIDE:
---
### This is a JavaScript file that is used to create a chatbot experience on a web page. When the user submits a message through a form, the script makes a POST request With the message as the request body, and then receives a response from the server. It then updates the chat container on the web page by appending a new message element for the user's message, and then appending another message element for the bot's response. The bot response message element initially has a loading indicator of dots, which are replaced with the bot's actual response when it is received.

# SERVER SIDE:
---
### The script is setting up an Express.js server. The server uses the OpenAI API to generate completions based on user input and sends the generated text as a response. The script also has two routes, a GET route for the root URL which sends a static message and a POST route that accepts a prompt from the client, sends the prompt to OpenAI API and sends the generated response back to the client.
