# Build and Deploy Your Own ChatGPT AI Application That Will Help You Code

# CLIENT SIDE:
---
##### This script appears to be a JavaScript file that is used to create a chatbot experience on a web page. When the user submits a message through a form, the script makes a POST request With the message as the request body, and then receives a response from the server. It then updates the chat container on the web page by appending a new message element for the user's message, and then appending another message element for the bot's response. The bot response message element initially has a loading indicator of dots, which are replaced with the bot's actual response when it is received. Additionally, the script also includes a "typing text" effect for the bot's response message, where each character of the bot's response is displayed one by one with a delay of 20ms between each character.

# SERVER SIDE:
---
##### This script is setting up an Express.js server that listens on port 5000. The server uses the OpenAI API to generate completions based on user input and sends the generated text as a response. The script is using the dotenv package to read the OpenAI API key from the environment, the cors package to handle cross-origin resource sharing, and the express.json middleware to parse JSON requests. The script also has two routes, a GET route for the root URL which sends a static message and a POST route that accepts a prompt from the client, sends the prompt to OpenAI API and sends the generated response back to the client. Additionally, the script sets some parameters such as temperature, max_tokens, top_p, frequency_penalty, presence_penalty for the OpenAI API.
